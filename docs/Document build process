The document build process begins with the YAML configuration of Polycraft.

This is parsed by an application specific python script that produces
generalized documents in the ydtar format.

These documents are then run through any desired ydtar target to produce a
collection of documents that can be Wikicode, markdown, HTML, Plaintext, even
LaTeX that can be compiled to PDF.
