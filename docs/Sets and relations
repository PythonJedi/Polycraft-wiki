Let I be the set of all items in polycraft
Let B be the set of all blocks in polycraft

Let C be the set of all conceptual entities in polycraft. For any c that is a member of A, a is a relation from a 
specified subset of the Strings to a union of I, B, the Strings, and the Reals. Each conceptual entity may have one
or more items or blocks that represent the concept. In the case of chemicals, there are three different items that
represent different amounts of the chemical. In the case of pogo sticks, there are gripped and ungripped versions.

Let G be the set of all ordered relations from B union I to the integers. Then R is the set of all recipes, and is a 
binary relation from G to G, where the resultant objects are mapped to the types and quantities of component items.

Let P be the set of all patterns in polycraft. This is a relation from the binary matricies to I.

Let M be the set of all machines in polycraft. Any member of B that implements a member of P or R. The relations from
M to P and M to R partition M, and fully encompass P and R respectively. 

An ideal wiki would have a page for each conceptual entity, where a page is a rather long string that includes
formatting directives to produce an organized and effective means of communicating the information about a concept 
to a player.
