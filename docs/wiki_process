Overal process description for migrating and maintaining the polycraft wiki.

See 'docs/Sets and Relations' for a description of organizing polycraft itself.

To make the project sustainable and reliable, approaching the documentation in
a different manner is required.

Currently, the mediawiki implementation used is
old and not entirely secure, requiring extra work from the university to
maintain the integrity of the campus network. Transferring to another wiki
format could be accomplished, but this still leaves the issues of limited
updating and only students/staff/faculty being able to edit the wiki. If
polycraft is to be embraced by the minecraft modding community at large, which
is necessary for continued success, we must have a standardized method of
allowing the polycraft community to participate in bettering the documentation.

Using a static html website that is automatically generated and built allows
the university network operators to do whatever they want in terms of security
as long as they can serve up html pages (which is the very basis of the web
server's purpose). when this static website is built from  information stored in
a github repository, anyone can help assist with keeping
the documentation clean and usable. However, no one can modify the official
repository without having their submission reviewed first. This add another
layer of safety in terms of the university's public image. Finally, the entire
site is built with an automated system that integrates the mod's configuration
data into the page and provides a solid templating suite. It also gives us
complete control of the look and feel of the site, insted of forcing us to work
with only so many themes.
