Descriptions for polycraft's .tsv files:

config: {
    alloy: {
        fields: {
            Version: Polycraft version number when item was added
            Alloy: Name of Alloy

        Description: This appears to be a "concept" file, as there are no game 
            IDs. As most entries are blank, this file is not very useful.
        Notes: Uses field is filled in for steel. This will likely be manually
            included in the Steel page.

        Description: Contains ID and name for all compound vessels in the mod
        Notes: Highly redundant, could be merged with compound.tsv on the 
            Compound field to have a single .tsv with one compound per line and 
            all the relevant IDs. For wiki purposes only need ID fields, as 
            names can be synthesized from %compound%Compound, 
            %compound%State, and %enum

        Description: Grab bag of items that have few variants and lots of custom
            actions/parameters
        Notes: Likely most difficult to parse, as the only unifying factor is 
            that they don't fit anywhere else. Good reason to not consolidate 
            tools of similar type into a single page.
