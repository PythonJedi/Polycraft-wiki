Todo for immediate proof of concept.
I need to be able to produce a large number of wiki pages, but I think the customizability is what will sell the point.
To that end, customobject.tsv is a good candidate as it has a large number of variant items that will have differing fragments stitched together from forms.

tsv transformations:
consolidate element and elementvessel
consolidate compound and compoundvessel
expand tool.tsv
consolidate polymer and polymerpellets
consolidate polymerblock, polymerslab, polymerstair, and polymerwall
